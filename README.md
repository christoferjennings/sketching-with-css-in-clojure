# Live Coding with lein-ring
This is just a modest fork of the cool work done by Daniel Szmulewicz. I'm sure what I've done here is done better elsewhere. â€¦ I just wanted to try out lein-ring.

To try it, open 
```
src/fioritto/sketch.clj
```
in any editor then run 
```
$ lein ring server 8888
```
Change things in sketch.clj and see the changes happen in the browser.

As far as I can tell, using lein-ring is not quite as responsive as Daniel Szmulewicz's emacs approach. But it's pretty good.
